Write a Fortran program that computes all the palindromic
prime numbers less than 10,000. A palindromic number is,
for ex, 11, 131, 323, that becomes equal read from
backwards. A palindromic prime number starts from 11. For
that first, you have to find prime numbers k, and test
whether k is palindromic.
